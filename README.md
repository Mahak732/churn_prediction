# Customer Churn Prediction
This project predicts whether a customer will discontinue a subscription-based service using historical customer data.  
It uses machine learning models like Random Forest to classify customers and identify key factors contributing to churn.

---

# Project Objectives
- Analyze customer demographic and usage data.
- Handle class imbalance using SMOTE.
- Train a machine learning model to predict customer churn.
- Identify the most important features influencing churn.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

# Libraries Used
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn

# Key Features
- Data Cleaning: Removed irrelevant columns, handled missing values (none found).
- One-Hot Encoding: Converted categorical variables.
- Class Balancing: Used SMOTE to address imbalance.
- Model Building: Trained Random Forest Classifier (optionally XGBoost too).
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report.
- Feature Importance Plot: Identify the most influential features.

# Model Performance
- Accuracy: ~85% (based on test data)
- High recall and precision scores after balancing the dataset.
